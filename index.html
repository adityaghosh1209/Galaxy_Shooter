                 This is a simple Galaxy Shooter game developed using Unity Game Engine for all ages including anyone under the age of 13.
                  I do not knowingly collect personally
                  identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
                  I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                  me with personal information, I immediately
                  delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                  and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                  personal information, please contact me so that
                  I will be able to do necessary actions. The app doesnot ask for any such information while you enjoying playing.
